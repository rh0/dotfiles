# .dotfiles

Thought id take some time and throw my common dotfiles in a repo.

## Installation(ish)

When cloning be sure to specify the `--recursive` option to pull all of the submodules.

Everything in the root of this repository should be sym linked to your home directory. Ultimately I'd like to make a small script to do the installation.
